## Design Patterns

These practices are reinforced across multiple sources:

- Progressive disclosure for long-context systems
- Plan → Execute → Verify agent loops
- Parallel agents and multi-worktree workflows
- Externalized institutional memory (CLAUDE.md)
- Deterministic tooling via scripts embedded in skills
- Treating skills and agent configuration as versioned infrastructure
